# Operating System Simulation

![example](CleanShot%202565-05-13%20at%2021.16.26@2x.png)

App to simulate how Operating System works

## Project Description
#### Hardware 
The computer hardware is assumed to have:
* A hard disk of size of 10 GB where 20% of this size is used to store the user programs.
* A RAM of size 192MB, where 32MB is used to store the OS.
* A CPU that executes one instruction each unit of time.
* An IO device for input and output operations.
* An internal clock that ticks every unit of time.

#### Operating System
The operating system is assumed to have:
* Job Scheduling: The program with the smallest size is first selected to be loaded in the main memory. We call this technique by SSPF.
* CPU scheduling: The CPU is allocated to the program with the smallest expected running time. We call this technique by SETF.

#### Program Specifications
Each program has:
* ID
* Program State: New, Ready, Waiting, Running, TerminatedNormally, or TerminatedAbnormally
* Program Size: distributed between 16KB and 16384KB
* Expected Execution Time: distributed between 16ut and 512ut and grater or equal to Exact Execution
* Exact Execution Time: distributed between 16ut and 512ut
* The expected IO Time: distributed between 100ut and 200ut

#### The Machine Execution Cycle
The following algorithm simulates the machine Execution Cycle:

        While true do {
            Increments the simulated clock by one unit of time
            (* This assumes that one instruction is executed *)
            If there are interrupts
                Then Interrupts the current program and calls the ISRi
            endif
        }
        
Interrupts are also randomly generated:
* The possibility that there are interrupts is 10%
* The possibility that there is an IO request is 20%
* The possibility that the busy IO device will terminate is 20%
* The possibility that the program terminates normally is 5%
* The possibility that the program terminates abnormally is 1%

The main simulator program is like this:

      While there are jobs in the H-Disk do {
          Run the Machine Execution Cycle
      }
      Print the required statistics

#### The Expected Output From The Simulation
At the end of the simulation, the program print the following results:
* The number of initially generated jobs stored on the H-disk.
* The average program size of all jobs.
* The average number of jobs that have completed their execution normally.
* The average number of jobs that have completed their execution abnormally.
* The number of CPU bound jobs.
